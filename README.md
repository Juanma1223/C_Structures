# C_Structures
Simple implementation in C language of the most used data structures such as Binary Tree, Linked List, Graph and a few useful algorithms such as sorting

Disclaimer: As long as I'm new to C language this is not the best implementation of data structures or a C coding example, this is just a lightweight library to use for simple programs or more complex algorithms
